## What is Entity Framework Core?

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an open-source, cross-platform object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with database objects using .NET classes and LINQ queries. EF Core supports multiple relational databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.

---

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **Multiple Database Support**:
   - Works with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Cosmos DB, and more.
3. **Migrations**:
   - Simplifies schema changes and versioning with code-based migrations.
4. **LINQ Integration**:
   - Enables querying databases using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).
5. **Lazy and Eager Loading**:
   - Controls how related data is loaded into memory.
6. **Change Tracking**:
   - Tracks changes to objects in memory and updates the database accordingly.
7. **Raw SQL Queries**:
   - Allows executing raw SQL queries alongside LINQ.
8. **Custom Conventions**:
   - Enables defining custom rules for mapping between classes and database tables.
9. **Optimized Performance**:
   - Enhanced features like compiled queries and batching for large-scale applications.

## How Entity Framework Core Works

1. **DbContext**:
   - Acts as a bridge between the application and the database. Manages connections and tracks changes.
2. **Entity Classes**:
   - Represents database tables as .NET classes.
3. **LINQ Queries**:
   - Converts LINQ expressions into SQL commands.
4. **Migrations**:
   - Manages database schema evolution by applying incremental changes.
5. **Providers**:
   - Abstracts the differences between various relational databases.

## Most Important EF Core Commands

```bash
# Create a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

# Apply all migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Remove last migration
dotnet ef migrations remove

# Drop the database
dotnet ef database drop

# Generate SQL script from migrations
dotnet ef migrations script

# Scaffold from existing database
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "connection-string" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
```
